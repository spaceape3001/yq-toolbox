#! Execution Graphs (XG)

Execution graphs are a type of graph, with commands and triggers, that are executed as a more approachable visual language for the end user; allows for faster reconfiguration.

# Nodes

Nodes represent a chunk of C++ code to do a various task, or make a determination.  A distinction between command & trigger is visual, the base C++ code allows for both from the nodes

## Priority

Priority in XG is that lower numbers are favored over higher numbers, it's "take a number" type of system.

## Always

Always mode/execution is one where a trigger, marked as always, will be evaluated every step.  While in always mode, only triggers with a lower priority will be evaluated within.

## Start Node

Start nodes is... where the execution graph starts.

## Category

More for convenience, this is a category for toolboxes.
