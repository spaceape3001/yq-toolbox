# CHANGE LOG

## Upcoming

* Lua support

## 2025.07.19

* ObjectInfo renamed to ObjectMeta (toolbox-scoped), this is to allow for the use of "Info" to be specific to an instance.
* Asset Overhaul, more in the drivers & IO.  The new driver paradigm should be relatively close to previous (in the signature), but also allows for more driver signatures.  Some library support is present, though yet to be vetted (the motivation for this overhaul)
* Asset **RENAMED** to Resource (this is to clear the name for use in the vulkan code)
